        <h1>You are a new programmer and you are stuck.</h1>
        <p>This web page is a bigginers guide to debbuging.
        Try these suggestions and see if you can get your project working.</p>
        <p>These suggestions are independent of language.
        If you ask for help too early it is hard to learn and gain confidence.
        If you wait too long you waste time and energy.
        They are steps to take before you ask for help.
        Each section ends with "Ask for help."
        As long as you are making progress keep trying.</p>
        <p>Sometime it is hard to recognize progress.</p>
        <ul><h2>Signs of progress are:</h2>
        <li>Limiting where an error could be coming from.
          <p>This is progress because when you find what part of your code
            generates the errors it is much easery to fix them.</p></li>
        <li>Knowing what input causes errors or if it is intermittent problem.</li>
        <li>Getting new error messages.
          <p> is a sign of progess because usauly means that you have fixed
            one error and found a new one.</p></li>

        <h2>Flow Chart For Complete Newbies on
          what to do when Code Doesn’t work</h2>
          <p>When you get a new error message
            or you learn something about what
            or where your code is going worng,
            celebrate. Follow that lead.
            When you get stuck again start at the top of the top of this page.
            If you reach the end of a list of sugesstions
            without makeing progress thats the time to aks for help.</p>
        <ul><h1>Which of these best describes your problem?</h1>
        <li><ol><h2>My Code Won’t Run / I got an error or other message
            - (usually Syntax errors or Compile Time errors):</h2>
        <h3>Syntax errors are the best kind of error to have.</h3>
            They always come with error messages.
            Error messages are kindly bud dumb messages telling you where your
            code is confusing to the computer.
            (about half the time the computer is wrong about what should be fix)
            <li><ul>Read the error message: look for Red to find the error messages:
                <li>On what line in your program did the error occor</li>
                <li>What the computer wants / <a href="KeyWords.html">key words</a></li>
              </ul></li>
            <li>Check Syntax, number/type/order of arguments, wrong type of function for type/array (in weakly typed goes other place)</li>
            <li>Look for an error before your line? Closing braces ";" initialization…</li>
            <li><a href="BeYourComputer.html">Be your computer.</a> check the spelling of variable names and their vlaues (sometimes your variables don't have what you think they do)</li>
            <li>Google the language + key words + sometimes function name (try variations)</li>
            <li>Comment out your line</li>
            <li>Ask for Help (explaining helps)</li>
          </ol></li>
          <li><ol><h2>My Code runs and crashes or runs forever – (usually Run-time error):</h2>
              <p>Don't change things randomly it causes distractions / creating other error / makes version control hard</p>
            <li><a href="PrintPutsAndLog.html">Add logs</a> of output, check if program is making progress, where is it taking time</li>

            <li><a href="BeYourComputer.html">Be your computer.</a></li>
            <li>Trace the decision tree.
              Look for flow control statements (loop, if …, switch)
              Check to see what parts of you code are running</li>
            <li>look for loops or requests </li>
            <li>Check your program line by line</li>
            <li>Comment out blocks of code</li>
            <li>is there anything you can Google</li>

          </ol></li>
          <li><ol><h2>My Code runs but I don’t understand what it is doing or it does nothing – (usually logic errors):</h2>
              <p>Don't change things randomly it causes distractions / creating other error / version control</P>
            <li>Look for what line/s in your code created the output you see</li>

            <li><a href="PrintPutsAndLog.html">Add logs</a>/ break point in your debugger</li>
            <li>Comment out blocks of code</li>
            <li>Ask why is the computer putting this out?</li>
            <li>Look for flow control statements (loop, if …, switch) Check to see what parts of you code are running</li>
            <li>Retype / proofread your code</li>
            <li>Ask for help</li>

            <li>Question:
              What are you being asked to do?
              With what input?
              What is the output?
              What are the edge cases?
              What assumptions are being made?</li>

              What process will you use to solve the problem?</li>
            <li>Complexity: How much space will it take? How much time?</li>
            <li>Test cases: Write some test input.</li>

          <li><ol><h2>I don't even no where to begin learning  about this program, software or tool:</h2>
            <li>For Code challenges</li>
            <li>if you don't understand what you are supposed to do run and see what the test are.</li>
            <li>Install make sure it is on you computer</li>
            <li>if exe try running it (usually not helpful but worth a try)</li>
            <li>YouTube name of program or tool and your operating system</li>

          </ol></li>
          <li><ol><h2>Problems that go unnoticed</h2>
          <li><ul>Security – a risk when you store private data or interact with users
            <li>Malicious user input (when ever you take data from users, corrupt user data)</li>
            <li>Transmission and storage of private data</li>
            <li>Authentication</li>
            <li>Lost access when passwords are lost</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Memory Leaks</li>
          <li><ul>Overwrite or Corrupt Data
            <li>When you copy or store data</li>
            <li>Over run of arrays in some languages</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Scaling</li>
          <li>Slow or inefficient code</li>
          <li>Bad UX and bad users</li>
          <li>Too big, small, null, wrong type, etc…</li>
          <li>Landmines how code brakes</li>
          <li>functions should work correctly and brake spectacularly</li>
        </ol></li>
          <li><ol><h2>Suggestions by type of statement</h2>
          <li><ul>If then
            <li>Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.</li>
            <li>Put blank lines before and after.</li>
            <li>Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.</li>
            <li>Watch for all or nothing cases not covered. In "complete" lists. Practice for getting user input. Use of laundry/grocery lists vs example lists;</li>
          </ul></li>
          <li>Conditional</li>
          <li>For loops</li>
          <li>Do while loops</li>
          <li>While loops</li>
          <li>Not while loop or Unless loop</li>
          <li>try blocks</li>
          <li>functions and methods</li>
          <li>timing</li>
        </ol></li>
          <li><ol><h2>Suggestions for style and structure</h2>
            <li>where and when to comment</li>
            <li>"Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Do not write massive files of code before you try to run them. Code a little, run a little, fix a little."</li>
            <li>Code openings and closings together. "" () begin end {} '' || [] For next/end</li>
          </ol></li>
          <li><ol><h2>Guideline for writing a tutorial</h2>
            <p>As much as possible teach good practice
              for coding the way it should be done for real projects.
              Teach the skills they will need and use.
              Don't just teach the language.</p>
            <li>Do a real project.</li>
            <li>Write test first.</li>
            <li>Start from non working code.</li>
            <li>Teach debugging starting form the errors.
              Show people what errors they can get and what it means.</li>
            <li>Build up code in small bits.</li>
            <li>When a section is complete refactor.</li>
            <li>Don't got strait for the best answer.
              Include some false starts.</li>
            <li>Include practice examples.</li>
            <li>Include different explanations
              for different ways of learning and thinking.</li>
            <li>Iterate your tutorail often
              and test your results empirically.</li>
          </ol></li></ul>
