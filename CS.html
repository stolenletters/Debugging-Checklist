  <p>I want to build a graph of interconnecting computer sciece concepts and implimentaions.
    The idea of Nodes connects to recusion and data structuers. The implimentaions start out with 2D arrays, linklists, and trees. As you add compleixty you get tries and graphs. The idea of pointers starts with the for loop.
