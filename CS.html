  <p>I want to build a graph of interconnecting computer sciece concepts and implimentaions.
    The idea of Nodes connects to recusion and data structuers. The implimentaions start out with 2D arrays, linklists, and trees. As you add compleixty you get tries and graphs. The idea of pointers starts with the for loop. Loops and recusion connect to the idea of repatition. Pointers connect to memory pointers and so to nodes. Pointers also connect to compexity and efficantcy. Implimentation of pointers starts with loops and leads to multiple pointers and double loops. Loops lead to max counters, frequency counts, and dynamic progaming.
