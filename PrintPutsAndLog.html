          Printing labels and values to the console
          can tell you what is going on in your code.
          It tells you when a line executes and what the value of variable are.
          <ul>Use these statements:
            <li>console.log("JavaScript");</li>
            <li>puts "Ruby"</li>
            <li>System.out.println("Java");</li>
          </ul>
          This is called logging.
          When we become more advanced coders we will write these to log files
          and only look at them when something is going wrong.
          For most applications the "user" never sees the console.
          So we are free to clutter it up
          with messages that are useful to the devvelopments team.
          Make your message informative and spacific.
          <code> Print ("i=" + i)</code>
          Once you put in a few of these
          things you need to be able to tell one from another.
