    <ul><h1>Key Words and what they mean:</h1>
      <li><h2>"Symbol Undefined", "Unknown fucntion", "is not a key word":</h2>
        <p>The function you called,
          key word you used,
          variable you refer to is not known.
          It usually means that there is a spelling error.</p></li>
      <li><h2>"Type mismatch":</h2>
        <p>The computer was expecting one type of information and got another.
          It wanted a string and got a number or boolean.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h2>"Illigal start":</h2>
        <p>This almost always means you are missing a closing
          before the line the computer has a problem with.</p>
      </li>
      <li><h2>"... is uninitilized." "... maybe uninitilized.":</h2>
        <p>This you are trying to do a calculation or assigning
          a value with a variable that may not have a value yet.</p>
      </li>
