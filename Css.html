  <h1>Debugging CSS</h1>
  <p>Debugging css is partiularly hard. css has many impliciti rules and relationships. So figuring out why your div is not as tall as it should be is hard. There are some genral guide lines to help make it easier. First css is applied top to botton. So if you set a color to red on line 10 and then set it to blue again on line 20. To a human it will look like only the second one happened. Actualy it both happen. First it will apply the red. And then before you can see it it will apply the blue.</p>
