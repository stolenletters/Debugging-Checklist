  <h1>Debugging CSS</h1>
  <p>Debugging css is partiularly hard. css has many impliciti rules and relationships. So figuring out why your div is not as tall as it should be is hard. There are some genral guide lines to help make it easier.</p>
  <p>First css is applied top to botton. So if you set a color to red on line 10 and then set it to blue again on line 20. To a human it will look like only the second one happened. Actualy it both happen. First it will apply the red. And then before you can see it it will apply the blue. If bootstap applys a color and then you load your own css yours will show up because it comes after the bootstrap.</p>
  <p>Most least spacific to most spacific. That is how many elements dose the rule find. This is why id apply stroger then classes.</p>
  <p>And Finnaly is imperitive. If you use the '!important' after your css statement. It has much more weight. DON'T DO IT. It may solve your momentary problem but it make's css even harder to untangle.</p>
  <p>If you have all your rules allign it will make it much easier to debugg. So load your css files from least important and most genral to most specific and important. That is why you load bootstrap or other libraries first. They have all the rules you don't want to write out your self. Then you overrule whatever your don't like.</p>
